# Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree - Behavioral Cloning Project

*My solution to the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Behavioral Cloning project.*

**Note: This project makes use of a Udacity-developed driving simulator and training data collected from the simulator (neither of which is included in this repo).**

---

### Introduction
The objective of this project is to teach the computer to drive car on on the basis of data collected in simulator provided by Udacity [here](.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2016/December/584f6edd_data/data.zip). Here we apply the concepts of Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks to teach the computer to drive car autonomously.

We feed the data collected from Simulator to our model, this data is fed in the form of images captured by 3 dashboard cams center, left and right. The output data contains a file data.csv which has the mappings of center, left and right images and the corresponding steering angle, throttle, brake and speed. 

Using Keras Deep learning framework we can create a model.h5 file which we can test later on simulator with the command "python drive.py model.h5". This drive.py connects your model to simulator. The challenge in this project is to collect all sorts of training data so as to train the model to respond correctly in any type of situation.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* model.ipynb python notebook containing the code to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code

Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

## Model Architecture and Training Strategy


###  Model Overview

* I decided to test the model provided by NVIDIA as suggested by Udacity. The model architecture is described by NVIDIA [here](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf). As an input this model takes in image of the shape (60,266,3) but our dashboard images/training images are of size (160,320,3). I decided to keep the architecture of the remaining model same but instead feed an image of different input shape which I will discuss later.

### Loading Data 

* I used the the dataset provided by Udacity
* I am using OpenCV to load the images, by default the images are read by OpenCV in BGR format but we need to convert to RGB as in drive.py it is processed in RGB format.
* Since we have a steering angle associated with three images we introduce a correction factor for left and right images since the steering angle is captured by the center angle.
* I decided to introduce a correction factor of 0.2
* For the left images I increase the steering angle by 0.2 and for the right images I decrease the steering angle by 0.2

### Preprocessing

* I decided to shuffle the images so that the order in which images comes doesn't matters to the CNN
* Augmenting the data- i decided to flip the image horizontally and adjust steering angle accordingly, I used cv2 to flip the images.
* In augmenting after flipping multiply the steering angle by a factor of -1 to get the steering angle for the flipped image.
* So according to this approach we were able to generate 6 images corresponding to one entry in .csv file


### Creation of the Training Set & Validation Set

* I analyzed the Udacity Dataset and found out that it contains 9 laps of track 1 with recovery data. I was satisfied with the data and decided to move on.
* I decided to split the dataset into training and validation set using sklearn preprocessing library.
* I decided to keep 15% of the data in Validation Set and remaining in Training Set
Final Model Architecture

#### Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model
After the full connected layer I have used a dropout so that the model generalizes on a track that it has not seen. I decided to keep the Dropoout rate as 0.25 to combact overfitting.

#### Model parameter tuning
